# Custom-Object-Detection-Model-In-Tensorflow
Build Object Detection Model from scratch using TensorFlow.

This project is the implementation of a hybrid model of Yolo8 in which the output is anchor-based. 
The training part of the model has been completed successfully and soon I will add other remaining contents (metrics and prediction).
